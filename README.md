# GoesBetween - Goesrecv to rtl_tcp bridge
GoesBetween connects to goesrecv, extracts IQ samples (aka "baseband recording"), and sends over the network via RTL_TCP. Clients like GNURadio, SDR#, SDR++, and SatDump can then connect to GoesBetween to monitor the spectrum around your satellite downlink, do parallel decoding via SatDump, and more!

README is a WIP, check back later!
